# Calorie-tracker-with-SMS-notification
This project is a calorie tracker that allows users to input food items and receive daily calorie count notifications via SMS. It integrates the Nutritionix API for converting food items into calorie counts and utilizes Twilio's SMS service for sending daily notifications. The process of sending notifications is automated using PythonAnywhere, and the collected data is also entered into Google Sheets using the Sheety API.
